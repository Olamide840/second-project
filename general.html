        <h2>What is Cybersecurity Awareness?</h2>
        <p>
          Cybersecurity awareness means knowing about the cyber threats that exist and how to defend against them. It includes understanding how attackers work, what mistakes to avoid, and how to apply safe practices when using technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Awareness is often the first line of defense. Educated users are less likely to fall victim to scams and breaches.

            Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It is also known as information technology security or electronic information security.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cyber threats have become more common in our daily lives — from phishing emails to stolen passwords. Understanding the basics of cybersecurity helps protect yourself and your digital environment from harm.

          <h2>Why Cybersecurity Matters</h2>
          <p>
            In today's digital world, almost everything we do — from banking to social media — involves the internet. Without good cybersecurity, you risk losing sensitive data, being hacked, or having your identity stolen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Organizations, governments, schools, and individuals must all take responsibility for staying cyber aware and safe.
