        <h2>What is Cybersecurity Awareness?</h2>
        <p>
          Cybersecurity awareness means knowing about the cyber threats that exist and how to defend against them. It includes understanding how attackers work, what mistakes to avoid, and how to apply safe practices when using technology.
