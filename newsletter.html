                     <p>Commodities, solutions, and inventions are necessary for the development of knowledge, however, there are difficulties when it comes to matters of justice and accountability! Official responsibilities, under challenging conditions, require careful assumptions and diligent efforts to uncover the truth.</p>
                     <p>The spirit of justice sometimes brings about consequences that prevent the escape of any future harm, despite the challenges that lie ahead. A clear and persistent effort is required, along with the pursuit of greater truth.</p>
